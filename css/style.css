/* Lessons Learned */

/* I was unable to get the buttons float correctly within the div. Basically they were all jumpy and I was using
inline-block and trying to float the buttons left. The paragraph tags were set lower than the button with an image
in it. Here's the old code.


/*
button {
	width: 120px;
	height: 120px;
}

#wrapper {
	min-height: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}

#pad {
	width: 480px;
	height: 480px;
	float: left;
}

#pad div {
	width: 120px;
	height: 120px;
	display: inline-block;
}

The problem was I wanted to float the divs, not the container. The container being #pad. Inline-block ended up
being unecessary. I also got rid of the divs in the hmtl file that were containing the button tags. I set the
button tags to display block rather than inline.
